### Hi there 👋

My name is Kunjan, and I am a highly motivated and results-driven professional with a solid educational background and extensive experience in software engineering and testing. I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science at Rutgers University, and I am working as a Student Operator at Laboratory of Computer Science Research (LCSR) at Rutgers.

In terms of technical skills, I have a strong core expertise in development, automation, and migration. My proficiency extends to a variety of technologies and frameworks, including various SQL and NOSQL database services, hosting services, containerization, data analytics and machine learning. I am well-versed in programming languages such as Python, Java, and JavaScript. Additionally, I hold certifications as an Amazon AWS Solution Architect, and in various Microsoft Azure fundamentals.

In terms of professional experience, I have worked as a Software Engineer at Tech Mahindra in both The Hague, The Netherlands, and Pune, India. In my role, I successfully led multiple software releases for the production environment, ensuring on-time delivery and optimizing release workflows. I have experience in leading new workflows into a new system. One of the main projects that I worked on was a business transformation project where multiple functionalities of multiple legacy systems were combined into a single application to simplify workflows and business needs. I have also played a key role in the migration of millions of customer records, demonstrating my expertise in coordinating cross-functional teams and utilizing tools such as Oracle Data Integrator ETL. Notably, I also created a comprehensive End-to-End (E2E) Testing Framework. This framework, developed using Python with Robot Framework (leveraging Selenium libraries), facilitates regular regression testing. The framework has proven instrumental in maintaining the integrity of systems through systematic and automated testing procedures.

As a Test Consultant, I conducted thorough analysis and mapping of legacy systems, mitigating risks during the migration of 600,000 customer records. My technical skills were crucial in executing network stack tests to ensure uninterrupted services for customers during migration between Telco networks. Additionally, I have contributed significantly to automation efforts, developing Python scripts and automation frameworks that have streamlined processes and reduced manual work.

Overall, my professional experience underscores my leadership in software releases, transformative projects, and large-scale data migration efforts, coupled with a strong focus on testing and quality assurance through innovative frameworks.

Furthermore, I have also been involved in notable projects, such as Scarlet Electronics, where I integrated Google Drive APIs and engineered a secure payment process. Another project, the Auction System, showcases my proficiency in Java, MySQL, HTML/CSS, and more, facilitating efficient auction hosting and bidding processes. My exploration of bias in StyleCLIP and the development of intelligent agents in the Ghosts in the Maze project underscores my commitment to ethical AI practices and innovation in artificial intelligence.
